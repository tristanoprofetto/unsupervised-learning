# Unsupervised-Learning Implementations
Applying unsupervised statistical learning techniques to clean datasets...Unsupervised models provide a method of inferencing, detecting patterns, and gaining insight on data which lack a response variable.

The most commondly used Unsupervised-Learning techniques revolve around **Clustering** and **Dimensionality Reduction**...

Clustering is a method of grouping data points into "Clusters" by minimizing the euclidean distance (or some other distance measure) between respective data points.

Dimensionality Reduction is the process of transforming High-Dimensional data into a Lower-Dimensional representation which explains the most important (highest variance) input variables while retaining the most meaningful properties of the dataset.
