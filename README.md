# Unsupervised-Learning Implementations
This repository is concerned with applying unsupervised statistical learning techniques to clean datasets (Python AND R).

Unsupervised models provide a method of inferencing, detecting patterns, and gaining insight on data which **lack a response variable**.

### Unsupervised-Learning techniques:
* **Clustering** :a method of grouping data points into "Clusters" by minimizing the euclidean distance (or some other distance measure) between respective data points.  

* **Dimensionality Reduction** :the process of transforming High-Dimensional data into a Lower-Dimensional representation which explains the most important (highest variance) input variables while retaining the most meaningful properties of the dataset.
