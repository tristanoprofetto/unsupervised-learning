# K-Means Clustering

Applying K-means clustering which randomly assigns observations to 'K' clusters (chosen before model build) and reassigns observations based on minimizing euclidean distance between a given observation and the cluster centroids... after 'i' iterations and observations no longer change clusters the final clusters have been obtained
